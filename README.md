# Vincr

Vincr is a [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/)-based application for calculating Vinc values for Vampire: The Masquerade game. It was developed as a quick prototype for a local LARP, so the error handling is not very good ("find Luke and ask him about the error.") Further work is certainly possible. This tool uses the House Rules for the Swift to Shed Blood LARP in Minneapolis, Minnesota; you are welcome to use it, as long as you don't mind that. Vincr is licensed under the GNU GPL license. 

The program has its own help text. It reads a CSV file picked with a file picker, than writes a CSV file with the new values.
